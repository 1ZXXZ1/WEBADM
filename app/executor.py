samba-tool command builder and executor.

This module translates high-level domain/action/args dictionaries into
concrete ``samba-tool`` command lines, appends common connection flags,
and runs them through the :mod:`app.worker` process pool.

Key design decisions
--------------------
* ``--json`` is NEVER added automatically by :func:`build_samba_command`.
  Routers must explicitly request JSON output by passing
  ``{"--json": True}`` or ``{"--output-format": "json"}`` in *args*.
* :func:`execute_samba_command` handles ``--json`` compatibility
  gracefully: if a command fails because the installed samba-tool version
  does not understand ``--json`` (or ``--output-format=json``), the
  executor automatically retries without the unsupported flag.
* The ``SAMBA_JSON_MODE`` environment variable controls JSON strategy:
  ``auto`` (default), ``force_json``, ``force_output_format``, ``text``.

    #     Auto-inject -H tdb:// for fast, auth-free, parallel-safe reads.
    #     NO -U flag is added (no auth needed for TDB).
    #
    #   Tier 2 — GPO commands that need BOTH -H tdb:// AND -U
    #     (GPO_COMMANDS_NEED_U_AND_TDB):
    #     Auto-inject -H tdb:// to bypass CLDAP DC discovery (avoids
    #     "Could not find a DC" errors in API subprocesses) AND
    #     also add -U credentials (GPO commands need auth even with
    #     -H tdb://). This combination works reliably and avoids the
    #     30-60s CLDAP/RPC delays.
    #
    #   Tier 3 — WRITE commands (COMMANDS_WRITE_LDAPI):
    #     DO NOT inject -H.  samba-tool auto-discovers the connection
    #     via -U credentials.  Without -H, most commands work in ~0.5s.
    #
    #   Tier 4 — RPC commands (COMMANDS_RPC_SERVER / COMMANDS_NO_H_FLAG):
    #     Do NOT inject -H.  DNS and DRS commands use DCE/RPC and take
    #     a server hostname as a positional argument instead.

    Fix v9-5: Added JSON mode filtering (same logic as build_samba_command).
    Previously, this function did not apply JSON mode rules, causing

    support it, even when ``SAMBA_JSON_MODE=text``.

    Unlike :func:`build_samba_command` which takes separate *domain* and

    segments (e.g. ``["domain", "auth", "silo", "list"]``) and

    Positional arguments are kept **separate** from *parts* so they

    If ``stdout`` contains valid JSON it is decoded and returned

    **JSON fallback logic** (SAMBA_JSON_MODE = ``auto``, default):

    1. Run the command as-is.  If it succeeds and produces valid JSON,
       return the parsed result.
    2. If it fails with rc != 0 **and** the error indicates an
       unsupported flag (``--json`` or ``--output-format``), retry:

        # --tmpdir that other builds accept. When we encounter an
        # "Unknown parameter encountered" error, we strip the offending
        # parameter from the command and retry.
        #
        # However, as of v12-1, most "Unknown parameter" warnings from
        # smb.conf parsing (e.g. "tmp dir = /var/tmp") are filtered out
        # in worker.py's _run_subprocess before they reach this point.
        # So this retry path now only triggers for CLI flags that are
        # truly not supported by the samba-tool build.
        #
        # If "Ignoring unknown parameter" appears, it means samba-tool
        # already ignored the parameter and continued — the real error
        # is something else.  These lines are also filtered in worker.py,
        # so if they still appear here, it means the error came from a
        # different code path.
